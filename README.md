# Bat_Corner_Detection

This project can be employed to detect four corners of a cricket bat.

YoloV8 is used as the base architecture and further trained it with the custom dataset present in the folder 'corner_detection'.
The code is available in the bat_corner_detection.ipynb jupyter file
bat_corner_model.pt file contains the weights of the developed model.

Corner_classification_CNN folder contains the files and codes to classify the four corners. It cannot be used to detect the four corners.

labelImg software was used to annotate the images
